## Part 1: Double Readings

### a) Life & Learning

Each student will select (or be assigned) two of the following readings and write a one-page summary for each. The summary should identify the interests of the various stakeholders. Further, students should identify what characteristics (social, academic or, where applicable, physical) these stakeholders consider important for future growth in and around the MIT campus. Students should understand potential conflicts and think about potential remedies.

Deliverables:   
Two one-page summaries of each reading

Due Date: Class #4

### b) Campus Form

Each pair of students will select (or be assigned) two of the following Boston-area campuses and study their built form. Teams are asked to analyze each campus according to nine categories, as described in the Assignment handout: land uses, blocks and parcels, streets, open spaces, edges/entries, building types, architectural implications, parking and transportation. Each pair will produce a matrix for each campus, with life & learning characteristics along the horizontal axis and built form characteristics along the vertical axis. Which life & learning characteristics can be influenced by built form and vice versa - and which ones cannot?

1. Harvard University - Cambridge Campus
2. Harvard University - Boston Campus
3. Northeastern University
4. Boston University
5. Suffolk University
6. Boston College

Deliverables:   
Characteristics Matrix

Review: Class #8

## Part 2: Individual Brainstorming

Based on the discussions about life & learning as well as built form characteristics, each student will study the MIT project area and devise a strategy for its future development. Students should indicate how the various stakeholder concerns will be addressed (or not be addressed and why, if applicable). To that end, students should consider which qualities of place are essential, which are desirable, and which are undesirable. Proposals should indicate what built form characteristics they think would support their ideas - ideas about the nine surveyed built form characteristics should be addressed in the proposal.

Deliverables:   
Context Plan - 1:2500   
Overall Plan - 1:1000   
Conceptual Model (plasticene)   
Description of Strategy (one-paragraph)

Pin-up: Class #12

## Part 3: Detailed Development of Proposal

### a) Basic Anatomy (the Overall Scale) - Conceptual Plan/Open Spaces/Uses

After reviewing the individual brainstorming proposals, the professors will form teams of three students, grouping students with similar approaches while ensuring a balanced team of planners and architects. Groups spend the next seven (7) weeks developing a detailed proposal. The first three (3) weeks will be dedicated to the basic anatomy of the proposal - the overall plan, with open spaces and some idea of the mix and relative quantity of uses. Groups must address the specific site conditions, including how to deal with crossing the railway alignment. Although detailed drawings of blocks and streets will be developed later, teams will need to consider the dimensions of these plan components in their overall plan. Groups should think about the timeline/phasing of development and include assumptions about how MIT how grow over time. Groups should think about how stakeholder concerns are addressed and design a potential community consensus building process.

Deliverables:   
Existing Context Plan - 1:5000   
Existing Project Plan - 1:2500   
Proposed Context Plan - 1:5000   
Proposed Project Plan - 1:2500   
Phasing Plans (4) - 1:5000   
Description of strategy/consensus building process (2 pages)   
Diagrams (civic structure, transit, use, etc)

Pin-up: Class #20

### b) Plan Components (the Block scale) - Streets/Blocks/Parcels

Once the overall plan has been more or less agreed upon, groups will spend two (2) weeks developing a more detailed design of streets, blocks, parcels and open spaces at a larger scale. Groups should develop a series of typologies of these plan components, illustrating the size and type of blocks, streets and development parcels. Groups are expected to produce illustrative drawings of potential streetscapes and major public (or open) spaces in order to convey the character of future development. Teams will be asked to examine a portion of their overall plan in greater detail to explore the components that comprise it more carefully.

Deliverables:   
Street Typologies (3 most typ.) - 1:500   
Block Typologies, including parcels (3 most typ.) - 1:500   
Blown-up portion plan (incl. major open space) - 1:1000   
Perspective views of open space (1) & streetscapes (2)

Pin-up: Class #26

### c) Guiding Principles (the Parcel Scale) - Building Typologies/Design Guidelines

Having decided upon an overall plan with detailed street and block designs, groups will be asked to think about what guidelines should exist for the area. Generally, they fall into two categories: urban guidelines and architectural guidelines - largely these are the constraints that exist at the level of the parcel. Teams will be asked to think about such urban guidelines as: building heights, setbacks/stepbacks, coverage, etc and such architectural guidelines as: fenestration, ground level treatment, materials, etc. In order to understand whether the parcel sizes and guidelines are feasible for urban housing, teams will be asked to develop a generic plan for one parcel in their blown-up plan, showing layout of units, circulation and how parking is addressed. In developing one parcel, students begin to think about what building typologies work with their proposed schemes.

Deliverables:   
Street Typologies (3 most typ.) - 1:500   
Block Typologies, including parcels (3 most typ.) - 1:500   
Major public/open space plan (most important) - 1:1000   
Perspective views of open space (1) & streetscapes (2)   
Urban Design Guidelines (illustrative diagrams) - as required   
Architectural Guidelines (illustrative diagrams) - as required

Review: Class #31 (entire proposal)

## Part 4: Test Outcomes

Having each developed a detailed proposal, teams will test the potential outcomes of the various strategies. Each group will 'inherit' a strategy/proposal/set of design guidelines from another team and will be asked to 'test' the potential outcome from the proposal. Acting as a developer, teams will be asked to design a building façade based on the guidelines, the generic housing type plan and proposed parcel dimensions. Next, students will collage their façade with other (existing) façades to produce an illustrative street elevation. The goal is to test the limits of the guidelines. Teams will also be asked to produce a generic pro-forma in order to illustrate the financial feasibility of the development of the chosen parcel, given the constraints of the scheme. Costs and revenues will be calculated based on current market data.

Deliverables:   
Building façade - 1:100   
Illustrative Street Elevation - 1:1000   
Pro-Forma Analysis

## 'Reading the Campus': Built Form

Note: Base Maps will be provided to each team.

### a) Overview

One group of students in the studio will study the MIT context and stakeholder desires to shed light on what characteristics of campus life are desirable to support a high quality-of-life. Another group of students will study the physical environment of existing Boston-area university campuses, quantifying the range of built form characteristics that exist. We will debate these two 'readings' of university life and attempt to identify the characteristics where the two intersect - that is, which quality-of-life characteristics can be addressed through urban design and which cannot. We will seek to understand the association between desires, potential characteristics and outcomes.

### b) Your objective

To analyze the built form characteristics of a Boston-area university campus in order to understand how the physical environment does or does not support desirable quality-of-life characteristics.

### c) Areas of Study

    Thinking Ahead: Should the future growth of MIT's campus define an edge to the city, or blend with the existing fabric?   
      
    Tasks:   
      
    1. Identify any clear thresholds between campus and the surrounding area.
    2. Illustrate the distances between such thresholds.
